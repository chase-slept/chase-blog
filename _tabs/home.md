# Welcome!

My name is Chase (sometimes *slept* ) and this website is a place for me to write about projects and ideas. I'm currently learning about Linux, AWS, automation and DevOps, but I also have broad interest in a variety of other topics. Learning and self-improvement are a great passion of mine and I also enjoy:

- reading and writing
- cooking and baking (and eating!)
- Philosophy, logic, and reason
- hiking, exploring, and enjoying nature
- traveling
- watching movies and TV shows

I'm not very active on social media and prefer to spend my energies elsewhere, but there are links at the bottom of the navigation menu for my Github and Linkedin profiles, if you're interested.

Lastly, this website is itself an ongoing project and will likely change or break. Feel free to poke around---maybe check out my Github or Project Log for recent updates!
