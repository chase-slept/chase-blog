# Hello and Welcome!

This post marks the start of this blog, where I intend to document my projects and learning goals. Thank you for taking the time to explore---I hope you'll join with me on this journey, wherever it leads.

## Who am I?

My name is __Chase__ and I'm currently an IT contractor, primarily doing some (admittedly pretty basic) data reporting tasks. Last fall I assisted with a data management/business intelligence project utilizing Domo (a business intelligence tool) to identify and archive unused/outdated/duplicate data across several data warehouses within the organization. That project was a great opportunity and I learned a ton about data along the way!

Since then, the bulk of my work in the field has consisted of generating some daily reports, processing that data into a different format and sending it off to an automated file loader to be ETL'd into some data pipeline or sent directly to stakeholders for use in their dashboard of choice. Important work, surely, but only required because an API hadn't been created by the vendor yet to cut out those first few manual tasks. Nevertheless, these projects have given me invaluable experience communicating with stakeholders and working with a ticketing system---both are skills I wouldn't have been able to develop otherwise.

## What is this?

In an effort to broaden my skillset and break further into the IT world, I've been studying various topics on a project-by-project basis. This blog is one of many projects I've started in order to learn foundational technical skills, and will also serve as a form of documentation for other skills and ongoing projects. __It's a challenge to myself__, to regularly write down ideas, problems encountered, solutions, and just generally share what I've been up to.

## What's next?

Now, with that brief introduction out of the way, I hope you'll follow along and find a post or two you find interesting. With this blog up and running, I'll be posting about other things I'm learning and working on, perhaps one of the following areas of study:

- AWS / Azure cloud certification
- Networking / CCNA
- Linux Administration
- DevOps

I look forward to sharing more in the coming weeks and months. In the meantime, I'll be updating other areas of this site and pulling together documentation for future posts, including one about my experience with Jekyll, which was used to create this very blog!
